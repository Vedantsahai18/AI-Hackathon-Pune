9,"With huge traffic and busy people in Bangalore, found difficulty when their car has broken down on the road.",1
10,Even roads are good but puncture are very common. Many professional companies are helping commuters with their local fleet and mechanics are available at their rescue.,1
11,Majority of the breakdowns are battery and punctures and some are major car breakdown that includes grear failure or clucth issues.,1
12,Car owners still want to avail for towing services even if that is only battery jump start.,1
13,Mechanics in Bangalore tow the vehicle at their workshop for major car breakdown.,1
14,Simple tasks that can make your car last longer.,1
15,1) Check the Engine Oil,1
16,"Do it regularlymonthly for a vehicle in good condition; more often if you notice an oil leak or find you need to add oil routinely. The car should be parked on level ground so you can get an accurate dipstick reading. Dont overfill. And if you do have a leak, find and fix it soon.",1
17,2) Check Tire Air Pressure,1
18,"Once a month and before any extended road trips, use an accurate tire-pressure gauge to check the inflation pressure in each tire, including the spare. Do this when the tires are cold (before the vehicle has been driven or after no more than a couple of miles of driving). Use the inflation pressure recommended by the vehicles manufacturer, not the maximum pressure embossed on the tires sidewall. The recommended pressure is usually found on a placard on a front doorjamb, in the glove compartment, or in the owners manual. Also be sure to inspect tires for abnormal or uneven wear, cuts, and any sidewall bulges you can see",1
19,3) Wash the Car,1
20,"Try to wash the car every week, if you can.",1
21,"Wash the body and, if necessary, hose out the fender wells and undercarriage to remove dirt and road salt. Its time to wax the finish when water beads become larger than a quarter.",1
22,4) Other Checks at Each Oil Change,1
23,"For normal driving, many automakers recommend changing the engine oil and filter every 7,500 miles or six months, whichever comes first. This is sufficient for the majority of motorists. For severe drivingwith frequent, very cold starts and short trips, dusty conditions, or trailer towingthe change interval should be shortened to every 3,000 miles or three months. (Check your owners manual for the specific intervals recommended for your vehicle.) ",1
24,Special engines such as diesels and turbocharged engines may need more-frequent oil changes.,1
25,"1. Get the vehicle out of the roadway: If a problem arises while driving, turn the car to the side of the road and out of the flow of traffic as soon as it is safe to do so.",1

29,"If you can safely exit the car, raise the hood and hang something white out the window or tie it to a side view mirror to alert other drivers to proceed around you.",1
30,3.Call for help: The next step on the list is to call roadside assistance or the police to alert them to your predicament.,1
31,"4. Assess the situation: If you know that you can tackle the issue yourself (if your car has run out of petrol, for example, and theres a service station nearby), go ahead.",1
32,"5. If your car has a flat tyre, do not change it unless it can be done safely: ",1
33,"If the flat is one the side of the car away from traffic and you can address it without putting yourself in danger from other vehicles, then do so. ",1
34,"However, safety takes precedence over scheduling or other concerns  it is better to wait for a tow if changing the tyre would put you in harms way.",1
35,"6. Learn how to repair your car: If you can positively identify the problem, know how to address it, and can do so safely, then go ahead.",1
36,"7. Be careful with strangers: While there are plenty of good-hearted people out there whose only intention is to help,",1

I figured, how difficult could this possibly be? I had read a few do-it-yourself books on auto mechanics and all those books for dummies. ",1
89,One reason for your car engine not firing up is a clogged fuel filter. ,1
90,If the starter motor starts spinning but the engine does not fire then it might be possible that the spark plug is played out. Either its wet or non-functional,1
91,"If the battery is fine and still your car does not start, chances are that the ignition switch might have developed a fault. Turn the key (not all the way to the ignition) so that the telltale lights on the instrumentation cluster light up). If it is happening then the battery is clean. Turn the lights on and then start the car. If the lights dim when starting then the ignition switch is fine. If not, then it might need replacement.",1

96,"Belts are the muscles of your car, as they make the internal components move. Damaged or broken belts are akin to tearing your hamstring  it really hampers your ability to move normally. Unlike muscles, belts wont get better with rest. Like a lot of mechanical issues, it is much preferred to prevent a broken serpentine belt than fix a broken one, especially since a broken belt can cause major engine issues.",1
97,"Although youll still be able to drive with bad brakes, as you can imagine, its not recommended. Extremely worn brake pads or rotors can make it nearly impossible to stop, which can lead to injury and damage to property. If you hear squealing, rattling, shaking or have problems while braking, take your car into a repair shop immediately.",1
98,"If you put the key in your car, turn it and hear nothing (or a clicking sound), you may have a problem with your starter. If this happens, try to turn on your cars interior lights or headlights, as it could be an issue with your battery. If your lights turn on, you know your battery is in good shape, and its likely a problem with the starter or relay.",1
99,"If your cars temperature gauge shoots up into the red, your engine may be at risk for overheating. If this happens, turn off the air conditioner and blast your heat. This will help move hot air away from the engine. Once youre home, check your radiator to ensure its full of coolant. If your radiator or engine overheats and breaks down, youll have a hefty repair bill on your hands. Keep an eye on your engines health.",1
100,After seeing/hearing several good reviews on Zoom from friends and relatives I decided to make my first reservation. But it turned out to be a nightmare.,1
101,"I booked XUV from 05:00 AM 12 May 2016 to 11:00 PM 14 May. My BOOKING ID is JPS6VUSB0. I paid a total of 18590 INR including 5000 as the security deposit. We started to OOTY at 5:45 am on 12th May with kids, wife and elderly parents. After travelling 200 kilometers the vechicle started showing signs of bad clutch. The clutch pedal will not raise off the floor. The hydraulics to the clutch stopped working. It looked like the master cylinder has gone out. This happenned exactly in front of Gudlupet government bus stand at 10 am. ",1
102,"The response from Zoom customer care was not prompt. After making several calls to customer care, they registered a complain for the break down and informed us that Mahindra Road Side Assitance (RSA) will pick up the vehicle and tow it for repair. The complain number provided was 75046. Zoom did not offer any alternate vechicle for our trip though I mentioned that I have made hotel reservations in OOTY. Instead they suggested to make our own taxi reservations for the trip. They also said, ",1
103,1) The amount paid for the remaining hours would be refunded.,1
104,2) That Mahindra would provide a taxi for one way drop to our destination OOTY out of which first 50 km would be free. ,1
105,3) The amount for the taxi would be refund,1
106,Later a Mahindra RSA calls me around 12 pm and informs that the towing truck along with a custody person had been arranged and that they would be providing the taxi to our destination OOTY. After some time the 3rd party taxi operator arranged by Mahindra called me and said that we would have to pay a 2-way charge for the trip to OOTY and the car would be sent from Mysore which is 50 km away from Gundlupet. I was not ready for this option since we had to pay for 2 way and moreover we have no car for site seeing in OOTY. The hotel I booked was outside the city and a car is an absolute requirement. So I asked them not to make a taxi reservation.,1
107,"Finally the custody person Sameer arrives at 1:45 pm.He inspected the vechicle and said that this was a hydralic failure and could also happen to the a brand new car and there was no fault of mine. We handed over the vechicle at 2 pm after some documentation. So I was stuck in Gundlupet for 4 hours. I had to make my own transport arrangements which costed me a heavily. When I called the customer care on 15th May at 7:45 am they mentioned that INR 5OOO from my account has been deducted towards vechicle damages. When I asked the reason, they did not know why and said they would register a complain and that I would receive a call within an hour. The number given was 185382. They did not mention anything about refunding the remaining amount.",1

It actually arrived while the app still gave its location as being a mile away but better early than late! The mechanic was great - friendly and efficient. He diagnosed the problem quickly (dodgy fuel pump) and though he couldnt fix it he managed to get the car started so I could take it in for repair.,1
356,After seeing/hearing several good reviews on Zoom from friends and relatives I decided to make my first reservation. But it turned out to be a nightmare.,1
357,"I booked XUV from 05:00 AM 12 May 2016 to 11:00 PM 14 May. My BOOKING ID is JPS6VUSB0. I paid a total of 18590 INR including 5000 as the security deposit. We started to OOTY at 5:45 am on 12th May with kids, wife and elderly parents. After travelling 200 kilometers the vechicle started showing signs of bad clutch.",1
358, The clutch pedal will not raise off the floor. The hydraulics to the clutch stopped working. It looked like the master cylinder has gone out. This happenned exactly in front of Gudlupet government bus stand at 10 am. ,1
359,"The response from Zoom customer care was not prompt. After making several calls to customer care, they registered a complain for the break down and informed us that Mahindra Road Side Assitance (RSA) will pick up the vehicle and tow it for repair. The complain number provided was 75046. Zoom did not offer any alternate vechicle for our trip though I mentioned that I have made hotel reservations in OOTY. ",1
360,"Instead they suggested to make our own taxi reservations for the trip. They also said, ",1
361,1) The amount paid for the remaining hours would be refunded.,1
362,2) That Mahindra would provide a taxi for one way drop to our destination OOTY out of which first 50 km would be free. ,1
363,3) The amount for the taxi would be refunded.,1
364,Later a Mahindra RSA calls me around 12 pm and informs that the towing truck along with a custody person had been arranged and that they would be providing the taxi to our destination OOTY. After some time the 3rd party taxi operator arranged by Mahindra called me and said that we would have to pay a 2-way charge for the trip to OOTY and the car would be sent from Mysore which is 50 km away from Gundlupet. ,1
365,I was not ready for this option since we had to pay for 2 way and moreover we have no car for site seeing in OOTY. The hotel I booked was outside the city and a car is an absolute requirement. So I asked them not to make a taxi reservation.,1
366,Finally the custody person Sameer arrives at 1:45 pm.He inspected the vechicle and said that this was a hydralic failure and could also happen to the a brand new car and there was no fault of mine. We handed over the vechicle at 2 pm after some documentation. So I was stuck in Gundlupet for 4 hours. I had to make my own transport arrangements which costed me a heavily. ,1
367,"When I called the customer care on 15th May at 7:45 am they mentioned that INR 5OOO from my account has been deducted towards vechicle damages. When I asked the reason, they did not know why and said they would register a complain and that I would receive a call within an hour. The number given was 185382. They did not mention anything about refunding the remaining amount.",1
368,I am still waiting to hear back from Zoom.,1
369,How to Deal with a Car Breakdown,1
370,Evaluate your surroundings and make sure everyone is safe.,1
371,"Pull your vehicle over to the shoulder, away from traffic around you.",1
372,Turn off the vehicle and allow it to rest.,1
373,Call any roadside assistance or motor club you may have.,1
374,"Wait for help inside of the car with hazard lights on, do not attempt to diagnose the issue unless you are aware of what youre doing and located in a safe environment.",1
375,"The good news is that when an issue with your car does arise, it can usually be quickly resolved by a technician who knows what theyre doing and has the right replacement parts on-hand. However, as technology becomes an ever-more present factor in all of our products, our vehicles are not as simple to fixed as they once were. And with the national labor rate increasing on a yearly basis, these vehicles that we rely on so desperately might soon be too costly to operate altogether.",1
376,When The Breakdown Occurs,1
377,"If Youre Driving: Evaluate your surroundings and the nature of your problem. If you can make it to a safe, open area  such as a parking lot  then try to do so. ",1
378,"Otherwise, pull over to the side of the road, and as far as you can go while still remaining on flat, level terrain. Your goal is to get as far away from traffic  and the chance of a collision  as possible. ",1
379,Remember to turn on your emergency flashers to alert other drivers to your problem.,1
380,"Do not try to push a disabled car off the road if theres any other traffic around. Similarly, do not remain in the car if there is any chance it could be struck by another vehicle. Exit the vehicle on the side away from traffic.",1
381,"If Youre Not Driving: Consider how important your plans for the day are, and contact whoever needs to know about the situation. This may be your spouse, your boss, your childs daycare center, and so on. Let them know your status and your plan to have the car repaired, then move on to the next step.",1
382,"Your car breaking down on a busy highway or interstate not only puts you at risk, but other drivers as well. With cars, SUVs and semis zooming by, its easy to panic. So what should you do if your car breaks down on the highway?",1
383,"You can prepare, minimize stress and maintain calm by keeping the following guidelines in mind and being ready for breakdowns before they happen.",1
384,"Preventive maintenance and repairs are always best. But even with good maintenance, things happen - especially with todays advanced vehicle technology. Modern cars are often vulnerable to hard-to-fix technical failures. Keyless ignition may drain batteries faster, for example, and tire-inflation kits, in lieu of spares, dont always work.",1
385,Steer clear at the first sign of trouble,1
386,Steer your vehicle as far out of the travel lanes as possible. Note your location for police or other responders.,1
387,"If you can pull over to the side of the road, exit through the passenger-side door, away from traffic, then stand far away - behind the guardrail, if possible. Many oncoming drivers tend to steer toward whatever theyre looking at, whether it's a crash ahead or a car breakdown on the roadside. ",1
388,"Next, call attention to yourself and your vehicle. You want to be seen quickly from as far a distance as possible. Turn on your hazard lights, don a reflective vest, wave a flashlight and set up reflective triangles or flares.",1
389,"If you cant remove the vehicle from the travel lane and cant exit, contact emergency services, turn on your hazard lights and keep your seatbelt on.",1
390,Prepping for car breakdowns,1
391,"Despite vehicle advances, it's likely youll have a car breakdown at some point, such as a blown tire from a nail or roadway debris. Stay safe by being prepared for such emergencies. Kits are inexpensive and may be bought at discount or drug stores.",1
392,Consider keeping the following items in your car: ,1
393,Cell phone with charger,1
394,Notebook and pencil,1
395,Extra medications,1
396,Vehicle operating manual,1
397,"Emergency service info, such as phone numbers",1
398,Flashlight and extra batteries (these should be checked often),1
399,Drinking water and preserved food,1
400,Jumper cables Tire-pressure gauge Reflectors or flares,1
401,Signal flag or reflective vest or scarf Windshield-washer fluid and wiping cloth,1
402,Coolant Fire extinguisher,1
403,"Ice scraper, snow brush, snow shovel and cat litter, in lieu of sand, where needed",1
404,Heavy gloves Thermal or safety blanket,1
405,A chemical heat source such as hand warmers Candles and waterproof matches,1
406,Jack and a flat board for soft surfaces Lug wrench for changing flats,1
407,"Toolkit with screwdriver, pliers, duct tape and adjustable wrench",1
408,Umbrella Extra fuses and fan/alternator belt,1
409,Park the car off the road,1
410,"You are driving along and jamming out to a Maroon 5 song, and suddenly you hear a sputtering sound and your vehicle starts behaving strangely! Well, the first step after a car breakdown is to keep your cool and not try to brake hard. Take your foot smoothly off the accelerator and try to direct it towards the side of the road.
