0,Burt Why did not you show up for class this morning? ,1
1,Kevin I do not even want to talk about it.My car broke down. ,1
2,Burt What happened? ,1
3,Kevin The engine seems to be busted.It's driving me crazy! ,1
4,Burt Wow.Have you thought about getting a new car? ,1
5,Kevin Yeah I have thought about that but I ca not afford a new car.I'm broke. ,1
6,Burt Maybe you can lease a car.It does not cost much.I know Toyota is running a promotion. ,1
7,Kevin Really?How much is it? ,1
8,Burt Zero down and $219 per month. ,1
9,Kevin That's a good deal.I might wanna consider it,1
10,With huge traffic and busy people in Bangalore found difficulty when their car has broken down on the road.,1
11,Even roads are good but puncture are very common. Many professional companies are helping commuters with their local fleet and mechanics are available at their rescue.,1
12,Majority of the breakdowns are battery and punctures and some are major car breakdown that includes grear failure or clucth issues.,1
13,Car owners still want to avail for towing services even if that is only battery jump start.,1
14,Mechanics in Bangalore tow the vehicle at their workshop for major car breakdown.,1
15,Simple tasks that can make your car last longer.,1
16,1) Check the Engine Oil,1
17,Do it regularly monthly for a vehicle in good condition; more often if you notice an oil leak or find you need to add oil routinely. The car should be parked on level ground so you can get an accurate dipstick reading. Don t overfill. And if you do have a leak find and fix it soon.,1
18,2) Check Tire Air Pressure,1
19,Once a month and before any extended road trips use an accurate tire-pressure gauge to check the inflation pressure in each tire including the spare. Do this when the tires are cold (before the vehicle has been driven or after no more than a couple of miles of driving). Use the inflation pressure recommended by the vehicle s manufacturer not the maximum pressure embossed on the tire s sidewall. The recommended pressure is usually found on a placard on a front doorjamb in the glove compartment or in the owner s manual. Also be sure to inspect tires for abnormal or uneven wear cuts and any sidewall bulges you can see,1
20,3) Wash the Car,1
21,Try to wash the car every week if you can.,1
22,Wash the body and if necessary hose out the fender wells and undercarriage to remove dirt and road salt. It s time to wax the finish when water beads become larger than a quarter.,1
23,4) Other Checks at Each Oil Change,1
24,For normal driving many automakers recommend changing the engine oil and filter everymiles or six months whichever comes first. This is sufficient for the majority of motorists. Forseveredriving with frequent very cold starts and short trips dusty conditions or trailer towing the change interval should be shortened to everymiles or three months. (Check your owner s manual for the specific intervals recommended for your vehicle.) ,1
25,Special engines such as diesels and turbocharged engines may need more-frequent oil changes.,1
26,1. Get the vehicle out of the roadway If a problem arises while driving turn the car to the side of the road and out of the flow of traffic as soon as it is safe to do so.,1
27,Take care in getting out of the vehicle it is best to exit from the side of the car that faces away from traffic which may be the passenger side door.,1
28,2. Make your car visible When you have brought the car to a stop out of the way of traffic indicate that you are stopped by using your emergency flashers. ,1
29,Reflective triangles road flares and small orange cones can be used to alert other drivers to your location. ,1
30,If you can safely exit the car raise the hood and hang something white out the window or tie it to a side view mirror to alert other drivers to proceed around you.,1
31,3.Call for help The next step on the list is to call roadside assistance or the police to alert them to your predicament.,1
32,4. Assess the situation If you know that you can tackle the issue yourself (if your car has run out of petrol for example and there s a service station nearby) go ahead.,1
33,5. If your car has a flat tyre do not change it unless it can be done safely ,1
34,If the flat is one the side of the car away from traffic and you can address it without putting yourself in danger from other vehicles then do so. ,1
35,However safety takes precedence over scheduling or other concerns it is better to wait for a tow if changing the tyre would put you in harm s way.,1
36,6. Learn how to repair your car If you can positively identify the problem know how to address it and can do so safely then go ahead.,1
37,7. Be careful with strangers While there are plenty of good-hearted people out there whose only intention is to help,1
38,the world also has its share of jerks that will take advantage of another person down on his or her luck.,1
39,Fuelling Type4,1
40,FlatDrain Battery,1
41,Zoom Car No help from Zoom forhours on the highway after a breakdown. Instead charged for k for vehicle damages.,1
42,This is a major cause of roadside callouts.Drivers who use their cars for shortfrequent trips are infact at a higher risk of this problem.,1
43,This is because short trips do not give the battery enough time to recharge.,1
44,To ensure you are fully chargedinvest intelligent charger to connect the battery for long period.,1
45,Leaving headlight running at night would drain the battery.,1
46,A common cause of the breakdown is linked to the fuelling problemsyet it is the easiest to prevent.,1
47,Alternator Has Fault,1
48,Always facing the battery related issues ?Also the headlight are dimming when the engine is idle?If soyour alternator could be having the fault.,1
49,When the temperature of the engine rises rapidlyand the ignition warning light comes onit could mean that the alternator driving belt and the water pump is damaged or broken.Once the alternator stops workingthe battery doesnot charge well and the engine is likely to cut out.,1
50,Clutch Cables Replacement,1
51,The clutch cable is a part of the vehicle that is exposed to lot of problems in the vehicle.,1
52,Should it break that can be serious problem.T,1
53,he moment you notice changes in the feel of the clutch when the peddle is pressedhave it checked immediately,1
54,HighTension Leads,1
55,High tension leads transport large amounts of the voltage to the spark plugsand tend to get worse with agemaking it difficult for the car to start.,1
56,If you are having trouble starting your carhave your ignition system checked.,1
57,Electrical Issues,1
58,Electrical faults are becoming common today especially with the increase of complex controls and switches in vehicles.,1
59,They can at times be fixed by changing the battery but when the issue is detected on the onboard computer the mechanic may have to identify the cause of the problem by plugging their PC into your car.,1
60,Electrical faults are becoming common nowadays with increase in controls and switches in the vehicle .,1
61,They have to be checked with scanning devices which is plugged to the car system and analysed.,1
62,Air Conditioning,1
63,Overheating is a major cause of the breakdownespecially in summer.,1
64,Always check your coolant level to avoid overheating or have your mechanic check the system.The coolant should also have enough anti-freeze.,1
65,Wheel Replacement,1
66,Punctures are known to occur even at the lowest speed and even the newest models of car are not immune to it.,1
67,Checking your tyre s condition is important as uneven wear and tear can mean they are incorrectly aligned.Bulges and cracks mean that you have to change the wheels.,1
68,Most people forget to refueland others only notice the red light flashing when it is too late.,1
69,The other is fuelling the car with the wrong fuel type.,1
70,Putting petrol in a diesel car for instanceis a serious mistake that can cause havoc and lead to extensive engine damage.,1
71,The moment you see you have fuelled with wrong fueldo not start the engine.,1
72,To avoid the mistakes maintain a sticker around the vehicle so that the person should know the fuel type to be fuelled.,1
73,8. Stay with your vehicle If you ve called for roadside assistance you ll want to be there when the tow truck arrives.,1
74,9. Keep an eye out for uniformed police officers All highways and major roads are patrolled regularly. ,1
75,It s only a matter of time before an official comes to your location to provide assistance.,1
76,10. Above all use common sense No two breakdowns are the same location time of day the problem ,1
77,and other factors make each incident unique. If you are familiar with the area and can find help within a short walk.,1
78,In Asheville I went out to the car one morning and it wouldn t start. After a few minutes of diagnostic workBrian determined that the starter was dead.,1
79,It was Easter Sundaydriving back home through a country road near midnight with my parents and we start to smell smoke. Assuming its from outside we do not think much of it and continue.,1
80,About a minute later my dad spots flames coming out of the air conditioning vents veers onto the side of the road and we bail out as fast as possible.seconds after that and the whole car is ablaze.,1
81,My dad had warned me about bumps. I was out on a date and went over a railroad track to fast the engine jumped the fan hit the hood and the clutch pedal slapped to the floor. ,1
82,I did not latch the hood of my car properly after replacing the wiper fluid at home so when I hit +65mph on the highway the hood flipped up and slammed into the windshield shattering it and bowing both the metal hood and glass windshield into the car.,1
83,On the way back we got stuck in a little pig town because the alternator belt came off (the wrong-sized pulley on the non-Bosch alternator ate it in half),1
84,I was driving down the road when my car started to sputter and shake. With a sickening lurch the car floated to a stop in the middle of a busy road.,1
85,If you ve got a problem with your battery there s a good chance it ll be down to lots of short journeys or a poor electrical connection. Battery faults are the most common cause of breakdown ,1
86,Spark plugs can break or wear out but should not be a problem as long as your car is serviced regularly.,1
87,I drove to a petrol station filled up with fuel left and headed on to the nearby roundabout. At this point the car lost all power a major problem having developed with the transmission.,1
88,I was driving back from the gym when all of a sudden my engine blew out on me,1
89, When my car broke down on the freeway I knew that it would be a while before any sign of help would arrive. I decided to pop open the hood and give the engine a try myself. I figured how difficult could this possibly be? I had read a few do-it-yourself books on auto mechanics and all those books for dummies. ,1
90,One reason for your car engine not firing up is a clogged fuel filter. ,1
91,If the starter motor starts spinning but the engine does not fire then it might be possible that the spark plug is played out. Either its wet or non-functional,1
92,If the battery is fine and still your car does not start chances are that the ignition switch might have developed a fault. Turn the key (not all the way to the ignition) so that the telltale lights on the instrumentation cluster light up). If it is happening then the battery is clean. Turn the lights on and then start the car. If the lights dim when starting then the ignition switch is fine. If not then it might need replacement.,1
93,Bad (scary) was a double blow out at mph on Aston Expressway after some muppet had dropped a spade in the outside lane ,1
94,Couple years age Xantia blew hole in back of engine lost power suspension steering and brakes in outside lane at .,1
95,Just last week attending a new Los Angeles-area Cars & Coffee my upper radiator hose exploded as I pulled in. While the steam escaping was impressive and made for quite an entrance I was stranded thirty miles from home. ,1
96,I had finished some errands in a town next to mine and was on the way back home when I heard a suspicious noise coming from under the hood of my car. Suddenly I started slowing down and the vehicle didn t react to me pressing the gas pedal.,1
97,Belts are the muscles of your car as they make the internal components move. Damaged or broken belts are akin to tearing your hamstring it really hampers your ability to move normally. Unlike muscles belts won t get better with rest. Like a lot of mechanical issues it is much preferred to prevent a broken serpentine belt than fix a broken one especially since a broken belt can cause major engine issues.,1
98,Although you ll still be able to drive with bad brakes as you can imagine it s not recommended. Extremely worn brake pads or rotors can make it nearly impossible to stop which can lead to injury and damage to property. If you hear squealing rattling shaking or have problems while braking take your car into a repair shop immediately.,1
99,If you put the key in your car turn it and hear nothing (or a clicking sound) you may have a problem with your starter. If this happens try to turn on your car s interior lights or headlights as it could be an issue with your battery. If your lights turn on you know your battery is in good shape and it s likely a problem with the starter or relay.,1
100,If your car s temperature gauge shoots up into the red your engine may be at risk for overheating. If this happens turn off the air conditioner and blast your heat. This will help move hot air away from the engine. Once you re home check your radiator to ensure it s full of coolant. If your radiator or engine overheats and breaks down you ll have a hefty repair bill on your hands. Keep an eye on your engine s health.,1
101,After seeinghearing several good reviews on Zoom from friends and relatives I decided to make my first reservation. But it turned out to be a nightmare.,1
102,I booked XUV fromAMMaytoPMMay. My BOOKING ID is JPS6VUSB0. I paid a total ofINR includingas the security deposit. We started to OOTY atam on th May with kids wife and elderly parents. After travellingkilometers the vechicle started showing signs of bad clutch. The clutch pedal will not raise off the floor. The hydraulics to the clutch stopped working. It looked like the master cylinder has gone out. This happenned exactly in front of Gudlupet government bus stand atam. ,1
103,The response from Zoom customer care was not prompt. After making several calls to customer care they registered a complain for the break down and informed us that Mahindra Road Side Assitance (RSA) will pick up the vehicle and tow it for repair. The complain number provided was . Zoom did not offer any alternate vechicle for our trip though I mentioned that I have made hotel reservations in OOTY. Instead they suggested to make our own taxi reservations for the trip. They also said ,1
104,1) The amount paid for the remaining hours would be refunded.,1
105,2) That Mahindra would provide a taxi for one way drop to our destination OOTY out of which firstkm would be free. ,1
106,3) The amount for the taxi would be refund,1
107,Later a Mahindra RSA calls me aroundpm and informs that the towing truck along with a custody person had been arranged and that they would be providing the taxi to our destination OOTY. After some time the rd party taxi operator arranged by Mahindra called me and said that we would have to pay a -way charge for the trip to OOTY and the car would be sent from Mysore which iskm away from Gundlupet. I was not ready for this option since we had to pay forway and moreover we have no car for site seeing in OOTY. The hotel I booked was outside the city and a car is an absolute requirement. So I asked them not to make a taxi reservation.,1
108,Finally the custody person Sameer arrives atpm.He inspected the vechicle and said that this was a hydralic failure and could also happen to the a brand new car and there was no fault of mine. We handed over the vechicle atpm after some documentation. So I was stuck in Gundlupet forhours. I had to make my own transport arrangements which costed me a heavily. When I called the customer care on th May atam they mentioned that INR OOO from my account has been deducted towards vechicle damages. When I asked the reason they did not know why and said they would register a complain and that I would receive a call within an hour. The number given was . They did not mention anything about refunding the remaining amount.,1
109,I am still waiting to hear back from Zoom.,1
110,Here are some general guidelines to follow if your vehicle breaks down on a highway.,1
111,Pull off the road.,1
112,Pull onto the highway shoulder as quickly and safely as possible. Remember to signal and try to remain on level ground. Alternatively if you need to pull onto the left shoulder ensure that you are as far away from moving traffic as possible. ,1
113,If you CANNOT pull off the road turn on your hazard lights. Do not risk injury by attempting to push your car to a safe location. If you are uncertain about your safety and think your vehicle may be struck from behind do not stay in your vehicle. Leave your vehicle only if there is a safer area to move to away from the highway.,1
114,Note your vehicle's location.,1
115,Look for a major exit. Note landmarks such as service stations restaurants shopping centres and business complexes. Do you remember the last exit name or any numbered signs near your location? This will be useful to know when calling for assistance.,1
116,Assess your vehicle's operating problem.,1
117,Did you hear any unusual noises experience any out-of-the-ordinary car responses or note any steam or smoke coming from under the hood?,1
118,If you must get out of your vehicle to assess the situation,1
119,Watch carefully for oncoming traffic especially at night or in bad weather.,1
120,Exit the vehicle from the side away from traffic.,1
121,Never stand behind or directly in front of your vehicle as you risk being struck by drivers who might not see you.,1
122,Alert other motorists by making your vehicle visible.,1
123,Turn on emergency flashers especially at night or in bad weather.,1
124,Raise your vehicle s hood. If you have a bright handkerchief scarf or light jacket tie it to the antenna or door handle or hold it in place by closing it in a window.,1
125,Call - Communicate your situation.,1
126,Once you and your passengers are in a safe location call . They will advise you on what to do. After calling emergency services call a family member or friend and advise them of your situation and location.,1
127,Call for roadside assistance and tell the operator,1

136,It s your responsibility to understand what services your roadside assistance or insurance policy will cover. ,1
137,If you CHOOSE TO EXIT your vehicle,1
138,When exiting the vehicle stay away from oncoming traffic and exit through the side of the vehicle facing away from traffic.,1
139,Be aware of your surroundings. Carry a flashlight with you if possible especially in nighttime situations.,1
140,If relying on the help of a friendly motorist ask for identification before accepting assistance. Write this information down and leave it with another person or in the vehicle explaining where you are going and when you expect to return.,1
141,If you CHOOSE TO STAY in your vehicle,1
142,Keep the windows and doors locked.,1
143,Do not leave the engine running for extended periods this could put you at risk of carbon monoxide poisoning.,1
144,If you are threatened by a stranger while waiting in your car call . Honk the horn repeatedly and flash the lights to attract the attention of other motorists.,1
145,Download and print CAA's Stranded Driver tips to keep in your glove box and keep family and friends safe by sharing these tips.,1
146,Firstlyget your car off the road and turn on the Hazard lamps. Inform your friends or parents (with the one u r living) .Then call the brand of the vehicle you are driving they provide walk in service wherever you are!You can just try getting help from the vehicles that pass by. You can even try calling the cops.,1
147,Call this number-080. I have read many positive reviews for this rescue team!,1
148,You can even try calling Ola or Uber cab. They provideservice. Go to your place and you can get your vehicle repaired the next day.,1
149,Hope this answer was helpful. If you got further queries please drop a message and let me know in the comments.,1
150,stopped in a parking lot or while driving down the freeway you should never react by panicking. Always stay calm and keep a level head. ,1
151,If you re driving steer the car to the side of the road and bring the vehicle to a complete stop.[1],1
152,If you have roadside safety devices such as flares or reflective devices set these up on the side of the highway so that oncoming traffic will avoid your car.,1
153,Do not attempt to drive the car further after a breakdown. Doing so could further damage the vehicle and put yourself and passengers at risk.,1
154,Call for help if necessary. If your broken-down rental car was involved in an accident or if the car breaks down at night or in an unsafe or unfamiliar area you may need to call for help. ,1
155,Once you re safely out of traffic use your cell phone to callor your insurance company s roadside assistance phone number depending on the severity of the incident.[2],1
156,Conversely if the car breaks down in a safe populated area and has no one is injured you may not need to phone the police. In a safe situation first call your car-rental company and then call a tow truck if necessary.,1
157,Read through your rental agreement. The document that you signed before driving the rental car off the lot should have clauses which describe who will be at fault for various types of damages to the vehicle. ,1
158,If you know how the rental car has broken down check the agreement to see if you will be required to pay for parts and repairs. In general unless you were directly at fault you shouldn t have to pay.,1
159,In general when renting a car plan ahead and always read through the rental agreement before signing. Well-known rental agencies are generally ethical companies but smaller agencies may sneak in clauses which hold you responsible for all damages.,1
160,Contact the rental company and ask for transportation. It s generally the responsibility of the rental company to tow the broken-down rental car and to replace the car so you still have a functional car to drive. ,1
161,However some companies may bicker over this policy.[4] Regardless inform the company immediately explain the incident state where and how the car broke down and ask for a replacement vehicle.,1
162,When you call say something likeI rented a car from your agency two days ago and the vehicle just broke down on the side of Interstate I-70 by mile marker . I d like to have a replacement vehicle; ,1
163,how should I have this car towed and exchange it for another? ,1
164,It may be easier to arrange transportation if your car broke down in the same city as the rental agency s offices. In an instance like this sayMy rental car is broken down at a gas station across town. ,1
165,I can t get the engine to start but if I take a taxi to your office could you set me up with a replacement rental vehicle? ,1
166,The rental agreement will usually specify that you must call the company immediately in the case of a breakdown follow this guidance as failing to do so may put you at risk for significant fees.,1
167,Keep notes and receipts from all repairs performed. The rental car company may ask you to pay for the towing service and repairs to the vehicle this may even be specified in the contract. If so the company should also reimburse you for repair fees when you return the car. ,1
168,To ensure that this happens take notes on what mechanics fixed and keep the receipts from all maintenance done to the vehicle.,1
169,Even if the breakdown is not serious i.e. the air conditioning doesn t work you should still notify the rental company as soon as you note the malfunction.[5] The sooner the company knows about a problem the less likely they ll be to hold you financially responsible.,1
170,What should you do?,1
171,If the car breaks down while you re driving quickly pull over to a safe place on the side of the road as far away from traffic as possible.,1
172,Make yourself visible to other motorists and signal that you re in trouble by lifting your hood and turning on your hazard lights. Stay in your vehicle.,1
173,If you don t have the option of pulling over stay where you are and do not leave your vehicle. Attempting to cross a road or highway is very dangerous and you ll be safer if you stay in the car.,1
174,Immediately call a towing service.,1
175,With roadside assistance,1
176,If your vehicle lets you down we will be there for you. If you are insured with LV= we have put together a short video guide about what to do in the event of a breakdown.,1
177,If possible try to pull over to the hard shoulder or as far left or as away from the road as possible. Switch on your hazard lights and if it's dark or the light is bad keep your side lights on. If you ca not get your vehicle clear of the road only leave you vehicle if you can do so safely.,1
178,If you cannot safely exit the vehicle and decide to stay in it keep your seat belt on at all times. If you can safely leave your vehicle leave by the passenger door and keep well back from the road on a verge or on the other side of the barrier if there is one. Keep a clear view of the oncoming traffic and do not stand in front of your vehicle.,1
179,Make a note of your location and the surrounding area and call ourhour breakdown line onor from your mobile a pay phone or a motorway emergency phone when it is safe to do so. Lines openhours a daydays a week. Calls will be recorded.,1
180,Hi i had given my tata bolt for a general service at adishakti cars bangalore the car was running fine before service but as soon as i pick it up from the service station not evenkm the car stops and does not start the service people tow back my vehicle to the service station then inform me that the oil pump has gone there was no problem before the service but as soon as the service is done this problem arises and now after taking rs for service they expect me to pay rs for the pump,1
181,after questioning about the service they say they have not checked the oil pump so it is not their fault then what is the use of paying rs it is just like paying money and getting my car damaged.,1
182,Roadside assistance is availablehours a day anddays a week. In the event of a breakdown you will be put in contact with the nearest towing company and at no charge to you.,1
183,If you are already a subscriber then you probably have a sticker or pamphlet with a number to call in case of emergency,1

349,Your engineer arrived withinminutes and sorted the problem .,1
350,Excellent service from (Richard?) - from AA breakdown in Dunedin today - thank you so much for the awesome and friendly service - helpful with explanations and suggestions - dealt with efficiently and thoroughly when I was stuck at a local beach carpark with dogs in a vehicle that wasnt going anywhere! ,1

354,Cannot fault you re serviceyou re man % brilliant cannot praise him enough,1
355,Technician arrived quickly and resolved the issue in no time at all with the minimum of fuss,1
356,My car was refusing to start so I called the AA using the app and was able to track the progress of the van as it made its way to me. It actually arrived while the app still gave its location as being a mile away but better early than late! The mechanic was great - friendly and efficient. He diagnosed the problem quickly (dodgy fuel pump) and though he couldn t fix it he managed to get the car started so I could take it in for repair.,1
357,After seeinghearing several good reviews on Zoom from friends and relatives I decided to make my first reservation. But it turned out to be a nightmare.,1
358,I booked XUV fromAMMaytoPMMay. My BOOKING ID is JPS6VUSB0. I paid a total ofINR includingas the security deposit. We started to OOTY atam on th May with kids wife and elderly parents. After travellingkilometers the vechicle started showing signs of bad clutch.,1
359, The clutch pedal will not raise off the floor. The hydraulics to the clutch stopped working. It looked like the master cylinder has gone out. This happenned exactly in front of Gudlupet government bus stand atam. ,1
360,The response from Zoom customer care was not prompt. After making several calls to customer care they registered a complain for the break down and informed us that Mahindra Road Side Assitance (RSA) will pick up the vehicle and tow it for repair. The complain number provided was . Zoom did not offer any alternate vechicle for our trip though I mentioned that I have made hotel reservations in OOTY. ,1
361,Instead they suggested to make our own taxi reservations for the trip. They also said ,1
362,1) The amount paid for the remaining hours would be refunded.,1
363,2) That Mahindra would provide a taxi for one way drop to our destination OOTY out of which firstkm would be free. ,1
364,3) The amount for the taxi would be refunded.,1
365,Later a Mahindra RSA calls me aroundpm and informs that the towing truck along with a custody person had been arranged and that they would be providing the taxi to our destination OOTY. After some time the rd party taxi operator arranged by Mahindra called me and said that we would have to pay a -way charge for the trip to OOTY and the car would be sent from Mysore which iskm away from Gundlupet. ,1
366,I was not ready for this option since we had to pay forway and moreover we have no car for site seeing in OOTY. The hotel I booked was outside the city and a car is an absolute requirement. So I asked them not to make a taxi reservation.,1
367,Finally the custody person Sameer arrives atpm.He inspected the vechicle and said that this was a hydralic failure and could also happen to the a brand new car and there was no fault of mine. We handed over the vechicle atpm after some documentation. So I was stuck in Gundlupet forhours. I had to make my own transport arrangements which costed me a heavily. ,1
368,When I called the customer care on th May atam they mentioned that INR OOO from my account has been deducted towards vechicle damages. When I asked the reason they did not know why and said they would register a complain and that I would receive a call within an hour. The number given was . They did not mention anything about refunding the remaining amount.,1
369,I am still waiting to hear back from Zoom.,1
370,How to Deal with a Car Breakdown,1
371,Evaluate your surroundings and make sure everyone is safe.,1
372,Pull your vehicle over to the shoulder away from traffic around you.,1
373,Turn off the vehicle and allow it to rest.,1
374,Call any roadside assistance or motor club you may have.,1
375,Wait for help inside of the car with hazard lights on do not attempt to diagnose the issue unless you are aware of what you re doing and located in a safe environment.,1
376,The good news is that when an issue with your car does arise it can usually be quickly resolved by a technician who knows what they re doing and has the right replacement parts on-hand. However as technology becomes an ever-more present factor in all of our products our vehicles are not as simple to fixed as they once were. And with the national labor rate increasing on a yearly basis these vehicles that we rely on so desperately might soon be too costly to operate altogether.,1
377,When The Breakdown Occurs,1
378,If You re Driving Evaluate your surroundings and the nature of your problem. If you can make it to a safe open area such as a parking lot then try to do so. ,1
379,Otherwise pull over to the side of the road and as far as you can go while still remaining on flat level terrain. Your goal is to get as far away from traffic and the chance of a collision as possible. ,1
380,Remember to turn on your emergency flashers to alert other drivers to your problem.,1
381,Do not try to push a disabled car off the road if there s any other traffic around. Similarly do not remain in the car if there is any chance it could be struck by another vehicle. Exit the vehicle on the side away from traffic.,1
382,If You re Not Driving Consider how important your plans for the day are and contact whoever needs to know about the situation. This may be your spouse your boss your child s daycare center and so on. Let them know your status and your plan to have the car repaired then move on to the next step.,1
383,Your car breaking down on a busy highway or interstate not only puts you at risk but other drivers as well. With cars SUVs and semis zooming by it s easy to panic. So what should you do if your car breaks down on the highway?,1
384,You can prepare minimize stress and maintain calm by keeping the following guidelines in mind and being ready for breakdowns before they happen.,1
385,Preventive maintenance and repairs are always best. But even with good maintenance things happen - especially with today s advanced vehicle technology. Modern cars are often vulnerable to hard-to-fix technical failures. Keyless ignition may drain batteries faster for example and tire-inflation kits in lieu of spares don t always work.,1
386,Steer clear at the first sign of trouble,1
387,Steer your vehicle as far out of the travel lanes as possible. Note your location for police or other responders.,1
388,If you can pull over to the side of the road exit through the passenger-side door away from traffic then stand far away - behind the guardrail if possible. Many oncoming drivers tend to steer toward whatever they re looking at whether it's a crash ahead or a car breakdown on the roadside. ,1
389,Next call attention to yourself and your vehicle. You want to be seen quickly from as far a distance as possible. Turn on your hazard lights don a reflective vest wave a flashlight and set up reflective triangles or flares.,1
390,If you can t remove the vehicle from the travel lane and can t exit contact emergency services turn on your hazard lights and keep your seatbelt on.,1
391,Prepping for car breakdowns,1
392,Despite vehicle advances it's likely you ll have a car breakdown at some point such as a blown tire from a nail or roadway debris. Stay safe by being prepared for such emergencies. Kits are inexpensive and may be bought at discount or drug stores.,1
393,Consider keeping the following items in your car ,1
394,Cell phone with charger,1
395,Notebook and pencil,1
396,Extra medications,1
397,Vehicle operating manual,1
398,Emergency service info such as phone numbers,1
399,Flashlight and extra batteries (these should be checked often),1
400,Drinking water and preserved food,1
401,Jumper cables Tire-pressure gauge Reflectors or flares,1
402,Signal flag or reflective vest or scarf Windshield-washer fluid and wiping cloth,1
403,Coolant Fire extinguisher,1
404,Ice scraper snow brush snow shovel and cat litter in lieu of sand where needed,1
405,Heavy gloves Thermal or safety blanket,1
406,A chemical heat source such as hand warmers Candles and waterproof matches,1
407,Jack and a flat board for soft surfaces Lug wrench for changing flats,1
408,Toolkit with screwdriver pliers duct tape and adjustable wrench,1
409,Umbrella Extra fuses and fanalternator belt,1
410,Park the car off the road,1
411,You are driving along and jamming out to a Maroonsong and suddenly you hear a sputtering sound and your vehicle starts behaving strangely! Well the first step after a car breakdown is to keep your cool and not try to brake hard. Take your foot smoothly off the accelerator and try to direct it towards the side of the road. Whatever you do signal your intention to the drivers driving behind you. If changing the lane is necessary carefully watch the traffic.,1
412,Flash emergency lights,1
413,You will need to give signals that your automobile is in trouble and make it visible so that others don t hit it accidentally. Alert other drivers about your car problems by putting reflectorized triangles behind the vehicle. Use emergency flashers and switch on the interior dome light. If the battery is dead raise the hood and hang a handkerchief or t-shirt out of the window or tie to the radio antenna. It will send police officers a signal that you need help.,1
414,DON T Try to Fix these Car Problems by Yourself!,1
415,Car Engine Vibrations Know How to Fix the Issues,1
416,Call for help,1
417,Look for the landmarks or sign boards to find out where you are especially when you are driving through an unknown area. Figuring out the location will help you to guide you the tow truck operator should you have called them.,1
418,Wait inside the car and use your cell phone to ask for help. If you don t have the number of any repair shop ask for the police help. Remember not to open the door for any unknown person except for emergency personnel or a uniformed police officer.,1
419,car breakdown,1
420,Call for help as soon as possible.,1
421,Get out of the car carefully,1
422,If you can t take the vehicle out of the roadway get out of it and stand away. Wait until the help arrives. You should also get out and keep a safe distance if there s any sign of smoke. However don t stand behind it because it can roll any time and don t leave it abandoned.,1
423,Some Precautions You Should Take,1
424,Car breakdown comes without giving any warning. So don t let it surprise you. Keep some tools and equipment within the vehicle to tackle emergency situations. Keep a first aid kit a charged battery a flashlight a spare tire fire extinguisher and water.,1
425,Also consider buying a spare tire if one didn t come with the car.,1
426,Calling for help,1
427,When out of harm s way assess the situation and call for help such as from Nationwide s Roadside Assistance which will be there when your car breaks down on the highway when you have a flat need a jump or get locked out. ,1
428,You can also lessen your stress with a set of emergency numbers ready so that you don t have to look them up. These include loved ones police and your roadside assistancenumber. Keep them in your phone as well as on a paper attached to your insurance and registration info. ,1
429,Staying calm steering out of traffic if possible and being prepared for an emergency can help you stay safe when your car breaks down on the highway.,1
430,24 hour call centre will co-ordinate and ensure that the roadside assistance service provider reaches the breakdown spot within the committed time. The centre will identify the closest Authorised Service Provider (ASP) near the breakdown spot and put you through a conference call with the ASP.,1
431,The ASP will reach you and make the vehicle roadworthy. Towing and cab arrangements are also made for vehicles that cannot be repaired at the spot. The vehicle can be towed to the place of your choice or repaired at any of our outlets.,1
432,5000+ Authorised Service,1
433,Flat or faulty battery,1
434,If you ve got a problem with your battery there s a good chance it ll be down to lots of short journeys or a poor electrical connection. Battery faults are the most common cause of breakdown especially in the winter.,1
435,When your car is serviced the garage should check that connections are secure and that the battery terminals are clean and protected from corrosion. Read more about how our patrols test batteries and get you going again.,1
436,Damaged tyres and wheels,1
437,Check your tyrestread depth regularly. If you can see uneven tyre wear your wheels might be misaligned. Get a tyre specialist to check or take your car to a tyre centre.,1
438,If you have got a spare wheel make sure that it's got plenty of tread and that it's inflated ready for use you never know when you might need it.,1
439,Many cars now only have a tyre inflator and sealant kit. If you have a jack make sure that it is in good condition and easily accessible along with any wheel removal tools and locking wheel nut adaptor.,1
