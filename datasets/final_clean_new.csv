142,It's a fact of life Your car will need fresh oil to stay functioning. However if you are finding it's needing changes and top-ups more frequently than it should there might be a problem. Early signs you need to check your oil include a minor dip in performance and the ever-dreaded oil light on your dashboard. When your car is in a particularly dire need of an oil change you may even start to see corrosion in its engine. Another oil-related complaint is the clogged oil filter. You will probably see this problem if you have waited too long to change the oil. While modern cars come with systems that are equipped with filter bypasses Its a good rule of thumb to change the filter whenever you change the oil.,4
